# What is CityPulse ATL?
CityPulse ATL is a pioneering initiative designed to bridge the gap between the people of Atlanta and their public officials. 
Our mission is simple yet profound: to empower individuals to report the needs of their city without the traditional barriers of
knowledge, accessibility, and bureaucracy.

# Tech Stack
- Language: Python 3
- Framework: Flask
- API: OpenAI API (model: gpt-3.5-turbo)
- Observability: New Relic

# Run CityPulse ATL
The CityPulse application exists within a docker container to ensure a consistent environment when running and because NewRelic required a Linux environment when using Flask.

config.py is not in source-control because it serves as a configuration file that contains the OpenAI API key.

To run locally, you will need to create this file and set OPENAI_API_KEY to your OpenAI API Key

```
# Configuration file
# Ensure that this file is included in .gitignore

# Development API token
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'YOUR_KEY_HERE'
```

Then, you can run the application locally, making sure to specify your New Relic license key:
```
docker build --build-arg NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' -t citypulse-app .

docker run -p 5000:5000 citypulse-app
```

# Usage
## Example prompts to try
